Find and replace the manifest.json file in Ublock's folder with this new one, then go to the "Manage Extensions" menu in Chrome and use Developer Mode, then hit the button "Load Unpacked", and navigate back to the folder and hit "Select Folder". You should be able to activate Ublock Origin. 
I can't currently test this on any device other than my own. Hope this helps!
